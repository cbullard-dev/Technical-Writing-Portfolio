# Technical Writing Portfolio

This is the start of my technical writing portfolio. This portfolio stems from my work as a Technical Support Engineer and Senior Technical Support Engineer.
Additionally, I have begun studying this topic to further build on the skills I have developed over the last seven years working in the IT industry in support and customer experience.

You can check out the details for this in the Wiki for this repository. For quick access here is a link:
